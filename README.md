## *Background* :globe_with_meridians:
This initiative focuses on enhancing the visualization of global earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to improve public and governmental awareness of seismic activities and their impacts.

## *Goal* :earth_americas:
The primary goal is to develop an interactive map that visualizes earthquake data based on magnitude and depth, effectively communicating the risks and patterns of seismic events to a broader audience.

## *Topics Learned* :leaves:
Participants will learn about data visualization, geospatial analysis, interactive mapping, web development, and API integration, particularly focusing on the Leaflet library for creating dynamic maps.

## *Full Stack Tools* :hammer:
The challenge utilizes a range of full stack tools, including HTML and JavaScript for front-end development, Leaflet.js for mapping, D3.js for data manipulation, and GitHub for version control and project management.
